I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science/Engineering from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). Currently, I am pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at USC.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **formal methods, robotics, and machine learning**, with applications in autonomous driving.
