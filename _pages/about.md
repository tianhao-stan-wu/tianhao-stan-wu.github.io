<br/>

I graduated from [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) with B.S. in [Applied Mathematics](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&poid=12767) and [Computer Science/Engineering](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=8&poid=7758). I am currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at USC.

My research interests are at the intersection of **formal methods, robotics, and machine learning**, with a focus on **formally verifiable safety guarantees** for robotic and autonomous systems. I'm particularly interested in autonomous driving applications.

Fun fact: Besides my favourite quote by [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) stated above, I also love the following claim by the great mathematician [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) that, ‘Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number-theory the queen of mathematics.’ I first read it in my number theory textbook, and was not able to taste the beauty of this sentence until I watched this wonderful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK32jo7i5LQ&t=133s) by 3 Blue 1 Brown. Couldn't described how fascinating it is to see that, "it all just happens”, beyond imagination.
