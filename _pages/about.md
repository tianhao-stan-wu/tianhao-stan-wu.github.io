<br/>

I graduated from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) in 2024 with B.S. in [Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&poid=12767) and [Computer Science & Computer Engineering](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=8&poid=7758). Currently, I am pursuing an M.S. degree in Computer Science at USC.

My research lies at the intersection of **formal methods, robotics, and machine learning**, with a focus on developing **formally verifiable safety guarantees** for robotic and autonomous systems. For real-world applications, I'm particularly interested in autonomous driving and drones.

### More About Me 

Hobbies: badminton, basketball, Rubik's Cube, learning different languages

Fun fact: Besides my favourite quote from [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) stated above, I also love the following claim by the great mathematician [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) that, ‘Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number-theory the queen of mathematics.’ I first read it in my number theory textbook. I was not able to taste the beauty of this sentence until I watched this wonderful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK32jo7i5LQ&t=133s) by 3 Blue 1 Brown (jump to 2:13 for a nice visualization). I couldn't described how fascinating it is to see that, "it all just happens”,beyond imagination.
