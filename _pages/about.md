I graduated from the University of Southern California in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science/Engineering. 

My research interests include **control theory, formal methods, and machine learning** to develop safe and intelligent robotic and autonomous systems. I am especially interested in safe control and multi-agent systems, with applications in autonomous driving and drones.
