<br/>
I graduated from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) in Dec 2024, with dual degrees in Applied and Computational Mathematics (AMCM) and Computer Engineering and Computer Science (CECS). 
<span style="color:red">I'm going for a PhD or research master after graduation. </span>


I'm broadly interested in **applied mathematics, dynamical systems, control theory, formal methods, and machine learning**, with applications in robotics and autonomous systems, especially in topics such as:

(1) safe learning

(2) autonomous driving
 
(3) interpretability and safety for AI systems

<br/>

Hobbies: Rubik's Cube; Basketball

Fun fact: besides my favourite quote by [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) above, I also love the following claim by the great mathematician [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) that, ‘Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number-theory the queen of mathematics.’ I first read it in my number theory textbook. I wasn't able to taste the beauty of this sentence until I watched this wonderful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK32jo7i5LQ&t=198s) by 3 Blue 1 Brown (jump to 2:20 to save some time). I just couldn't described how fascinating it is to simply see that "it all just happened", beyond imagination.
