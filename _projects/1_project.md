I was doing summer research at UCI and learning about drones. One day, I came to watch a YouTube video about how to build a FPV drone. That was so cool, and I made my mind to build one. Then I bought all the components, followed the video, and finally made it! Though there were many technical problems that blew my mind from time to time, such as hardware compatibility issues, software configurations, bad soldering, etc. , I'm glad it worked magically in the end. Watch the following video if you wonder how I built it!
